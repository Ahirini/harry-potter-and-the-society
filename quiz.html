            <p>...</p>
            <p>You keep things classic, and you love when books draw you in to another world. One of your favorite daydreams is falling down a rabbit hole or gaining superpowers or, of course, receiving a Hogwarts letter. People enjoy your whimsical and youthful spirit, and you're quite an optimist, whether you realize it or not. And your copy of Sorcerer's Stone is battered beyond belief, because you've read it countless times.</p>

        <div class="result-text" id="chamber">
            <img class="result-image" src="Images/chamber.jpg">
            <p>...</p>
            <p>You don't judge a person by rumors you've heard, because you know that sometimes learning a bit of backstory will completely change your mind. Though you've had your share of tough days and can relate to the feeling that dementors inspire, you're also incredibly hopeful (and you know that chocolate can help a lot). You also own a time-turner necklace and you REALLY want to visit Hogsmeade.</p>

        <div class="result-text" id="goblet">
            <img class="result-image" src="Images/goblet.jpg">
            <p>Let's be real: You love a bit of drama. From exciting tournaments to sporting events to fancy balls, you're all adventure, all the time. You DEFINITELY would have entered your name into the Goblet of Fire, and you've got strong opinions on the different relationships in the book. Mostly, you're an adrenaline seeker who loves solving difficult problems, whether they're problems of the heart, riddles, or physical challenges.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="result-text" id="order">
            <img class="result-image" src="Images/order.jpg">
            <p>You went through an angsty phase. In fact, you've always been a bit of a rebel, and you've definitely said the words "No one understands me" (or at least thought them). When it comes down to it, though, you're fiercely loyal to the ones you love, and you're always the first to stand up for the underdog. You're also a bit fascinated by mystery and the things in life you don't understand — you love spending time pondering the deeper questions in life.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="result-text" id="prince">
            <img class="result-image" src="Images/prince.jpg">
            <p>You. Love. LOVE. One of your favorite parts of the Harry Potter series is the personal relationships between the characters, and you're very dedicated to your favorite 'ships. In your own life, you always have your friends' backs, though you may get distracted sometimes by new romantic prospects. Still, at the end of the day, you're a true friend, and you always stand up for what's right. You love justice and learning, and have a very DIY-attitude when it comes to getting things done.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="result-text" id="hallows">
            <img class="result-image" src="Images/hallows.jpg">
            <p>When all the loose ends are tied up, you're happy. Some may call you a perfectionist, but really, you just want things to be right for the people you care about. You have a fighting spirit, and wouldn't have hesitated to sign up for the Battle of Hogwarts. You're detail-oriented, patient and loyal, and when you hear the words "always" or "all was well," you immediately burst into tears.</p>
